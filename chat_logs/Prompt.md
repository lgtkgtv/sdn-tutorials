# Linux Foundation Networking:

Hi, tell me about the Essedum project recently launch by the Linux Foundation. Tell me what is it about and why shall I care based on my inetrests 
in simplifying, standardizing and streamlining (automation) of DevSecOp practices for AI/ML and cloud applications. Also note that I am not a business, currently looking for a job and do not want to waste time learning about science projects that may not go anywhere in terms of industry adoption and jobs/ careear prospects. I do have a general interest and affinity for "software defined infrastructure", "software defined networking" etc topics as I believe they lead to simplified modular and reusable designs and implementations. 

Here are someof the urls's related to some key  Linux Foundation Networking projects:

Stay focused on providing me an understanding if there is already some great adoption and reuse of the technologies developed under these umbrella open source projects. I am technologiest. Show me the code! Show me that the code actually works! Show me  the innovation, standardization, reuse, simplification and illustrate that with small simple examples that will build upon each other to create a comprehensive story. In the end put together a project in the form of a series of step by step jupyter notebook styles tutorials with incremental features to realize the "software defined EVERYTHING" story.
